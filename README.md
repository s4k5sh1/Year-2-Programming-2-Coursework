# Year-2-Programming-2-Coursework

## **Description**

This repository contains the coursework for Year 2 Programming, focusing on Python programming techniques and concepts. The coursework is divided into two main assignments, each addressing different aspects of Python programming and problem-solving.

## **Assignment 1: DNA Sequence Processing**

- **Objective**: Implement a Python module 'dna.py' that provides functions for processing nucleic acid sequences. This module should be importable into other Python scripts and should not import any external modules itself.
- **Requirements**:
1) Write 9 functions in dna.py to perform various tasks related to DNA sequence processing.
2) he module should be importable using import dna and the functions callable as dna.function_name().
  
## **Assignment 2: Cell Population Simulation**

- **Objective**:  Implement a Python module cellsim.py that simulates the growth and death of a population of cells. This simulation involves creating a two-dimensional grid representing tissue, with cells that can be healthy, cancerous, or dead.
- **Requirements**:
1)  Write three classes: Tissue, Cell, and Cancer.
2) Tissue: Represents a 2D grid with rows and columns, containing cells of different types.
3) Cell: Represents a healthy cell, alive cells are denoted by 'O'.
4) Cancer: Represents a cancerous cell, alive cells are denoted by 'X'.
5) Dead cells are represented by '.'.
6) The simulation should support importing the module using import cellsim and allow for simulation setup and execution.
